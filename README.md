Automate your computer to save cummulative hours of your life a year,
and watch your mundane work do itself.

Autohotkey is a powerful scripting language that sends keystrokes,
runs programs and processes information so that you can focus on
important things in life.

Batteries are included: these scripts ask for your information and
save it to an ini file, so no code editing is required to get running.
